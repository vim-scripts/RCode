Commands And Maps:
:Rcode		Start Rcode. Accept an argument as the language, eg:
		vim, awk, etc. Use <C-D> to see all available ones.
		A new buffer will be opened for you. Write your code
		in it.
		You can give a range.

:RcLoad {name}	Load a previous saved code snippet.
      		"name" should be in the form "{lang}/{filename}" so
      		that the script knows which language it's in. This is
      		different from ":Save" command.
		You can give a range.

:RcSelect	List all available code snippets and you can choose
      		one by number

In Rcode buffer:

<C-CR>
:Run		Run your code against the buffer you were.
:Save {name}	Save your code so you can later load it with
      		":RcLoad"

Shortcut:
in Python, 'v' is the 'vim' module, and 'b' is the current buffer,
in Lua, 'b' is the current buffer.

Settings:
g:Rcode_after	what to do after running your code.
		0 means to do noting, 1 means to close the code buffer
		and 2 will throw away your code besides closing the
		buffer, or you code will be loaded next time you use
		":Rcode".
