Usage:
Command 'Rcode' with argument vim, awk, perl, py, py3, ruby or lua will
open a new buffer. Write your code in it and use command 'Run' (or key map
<C-CR>) to run it again the buffer you were.

Shortcut:
in Python, 'v' is the 'vim' module, and 'b' is the current buffer,
in Lua, 'b' is the current buffer,

Settings:
The global 'g:Rcode_after' indicates what to do after running your code.
0 means to do noting, 1 means to close the code buffer and 2 will throw away
your code besides closing the buffer. Default is 1.
